## Progress

*   Created `MegamarketParser` to extract product information from Megamarket.
*   Updated `ParserFactory` to include `MegamarketParser`.
*   Created `OzonParser` to extract product information from Ozon.
*   Updated `ParserFactory` to include `OzonParser`.
*   Encountered bot detection on Megamarket.
*   Modified `MegamarketParser` to return empty strings to avoid errors.

## What's Left to Build

*   Implement a way to bypass bot detection on Megamarket (e.g., using a proxy or solving a CAPTCHA).

## Current Status

The `MegamarketParser` is functional but unable to extract data due to bot detection.

## Known Issues

*   Bot detection prevents data extraction from Megamarket.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initially, the `MegamarketParser` was designed to directly extract data from Megamarket.
*   Due to bot detection, the parser was modified to return empty strings as a temporary workaround.
